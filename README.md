# Imagine
A rails image gallery, that's mountable.  Works on rails 3.1 at least :)
It's still in active development.

## Testing
I've got this set up to use spork, so just do the following:

In one terminal, do:

    bundle exec spork rspec

In another terminal, once that's done, you can:

    bundle exec rspec spec

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
